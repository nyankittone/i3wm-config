# What is this?
This is my own personal config for i3 that I use every day.

Note that this is set up according to my specific moniotor layout and programs that I use.
(i.e. it valls polybar in the config) You will have to make some adjustments to use this
effectively on your system.

Uuuh, yeah, that's it. I guess look at the LICENSE file? 🤷‍♀️ (it's public domain btw 😎)
