# What is this?
This is my own personal config for i3 that I use every day.

Note that this is set up according to my specific moniotor layout and programs that I use.
(i.e. it valls polybar in the config) You will have to make some adjustments to use this
effectively on your system.

Uuuh, yeah, that's it. I guess look at the LICENSE file? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (it's public domain btw üòé)

# What I might change in the future
+ Some of the keybinds I have sset are in weird spots, because many of them had to be used for
  the workspaces
+ I need to find better keybinds for resizing the windows. Right now, I'm using Super+Alt+[hjhkl]
  for it. I don't want to use the Alt key.
+ I want to write a "configuration" script, that will update the config with stuff appropriate
  for a specific monitor setup automatically, or something. Right now, that must be done manually.
  Bleh.
+ Add variables for workspace names in the config
