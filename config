# i3 config file (v4)
# Please see https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html for a complete reference!

# This config has been split apart into multiple different files to try to give it a separation
# of concerns. I'm not really sure how good I've done of that, but nevertheless, this is how it is.

# Due to limitations in i3's config language, all global variables used in this config must be
# placed here in the main file, instead of in another file to keep with this idea. Oh well.

# Loading vital components of the graphical environment, like polybar and a compositor
include components_init

# Actually setting globals here
set $mod Mod4
set $alt Mod1
set $mon1 primary
set $mon2 DP-4

# And here it is - the wall of includes!
include workspaces
include gaps
include window_management
include resize
include theme
include volume_control
include modes/execute
include modes/power
include modes/screenshot

# Tying up some loose ends that I couldn't organize neatly. Here's we're just setting up fonts, and
# some keybionds for closing windows, reloading i3's config, and restarting it in-placce,
# respectively.
